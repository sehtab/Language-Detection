# Objective:

The objective of this ICP is to get familiar with Basic NLTK functions and definetions and accessing the corpus and see the concordance, colloqual, dispersion plot and frequency plot and language detection from the corpus and a sample sentence.

# Approaches

To accessing the corpus "reuters" corpus is used and after taking a sample sentence concordance, colloqual, dispersion plot and frequency plot is obtained.

# Datasets

For NLTK basic and Language detection 'Gutenberg' and 'Genesis'corpus are used respectively. For NLTK basic 'paradise lost' is used as sample file to extract sentence and so on and for language detection 'finnish' is used as an example to detect language.

# Results:

Results are generated from nltk library function and they are working good. From 'Paradise Lost' sample paragraph are extracted and concordance, colloqual, dispersion plot and word frequency plots are obtained. For language detection 'finnish' language is used as sample and spacey did a really good job in detecting language and most frequent words.

# Challenges

Using sklearn most frequent word can not be obtained.

# Planned Work

For this ICP 'gutenberg' and 'genesis' corpus are used and using this two corpus all the works are done. For NLTK basic, from gutenberg corpus paradise lost apagraph is extracted as sample paragraph then lower, punctuation, stop word are applied and concordance, colloqual, dispersion plot and word frequency plot are obtained. 

For language detection, from genesis corpus finnish language is choosed for detection and using spacey library language is detected successfully.
